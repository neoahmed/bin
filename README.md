# Personal helper scripts that live in `$HOME/bin`

>[!important]
Shell scripts are not the best way to implement a DWM status bar, since they often loop and call external programs repeatedly, which is heavy.  
A lightweight C implementation (e.g. [`slstatus`](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/)) is usually better, I will figure it out later.
